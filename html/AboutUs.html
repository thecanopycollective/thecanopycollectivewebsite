    In 2024, three grassroots, refugee-led organisations - Action for Women
    (AfW), Maz√≠ Housing (MH), and Velos Youth (VY) - came together to form the
    Canopy Collective. This first-of-its-kind collaboration addresses the
    growing service gaps, barriers, and challenges young refugees and asylum
    seekers face in Athens, Greece.
